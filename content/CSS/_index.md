CSS is a fully managed service to provide reliable, high-quality, low-latency live streaming easily and conveniently. CSS helps you configure your live streaming lifecycle quickly and easily by templates that allow you to quickly and easily create and delete live channels.
After configuring your CSS channel using a template and getting your live feed into the cloud, you can get the playback URL. This means CSS manages the transcoding, packaging, and reliably delivers streaming video to viewers through the CSS CDN.
