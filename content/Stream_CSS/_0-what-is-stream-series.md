## CSS CDN

Cloud Streaming Service (CSS) is a fully managed service that can be used in use cases such as UGC (User Generated Content) or media entertainment.

**This is a service that can meet the needs of customers who have requirements such as channel templating, fast channel creation, easy and simple operation, and low latency**.

This CSS channel is domain-based and consists of two large domain components: Push and Play.

Here, **CSS's Play domain can be used exclusively as a CSS CDN**. In other words, it can be integrated with CSS and used as a fully managed service, or it can be integrated with other streaming packaging & origin services and used as a **Streaming CDN** suitable for Live Streaming.
