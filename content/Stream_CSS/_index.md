Tencent Cloud provides media services that can meet almost all customer use cases, from live streaming to video on demand.

Among them, CSS is a fully managed service to provide stable, high-quality, low-latency live streaming easily and conveniently.
I mentioned earlier that CSS consists of two major components: Push and Play. The Play component can be a standalone component that provides a CDN optimized for Live Streaming.

CSS CDN (CSS Play component) can be used simply as a fully managed CSS, or **integrated with other live streaming origination services**.

Tencent Cloud provides **Stream Link, Stream Live, and Stream Package** services that provide broadcast-grade quality and functionality.

This time, we will look at this **CSS CDN and Stream Series integration** example on Tencent Cloud.
